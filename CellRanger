# this is the layout for how I will do CellRanger
## 1. Bring files from HPC where they are stored to 10x Cloud. To do this, see "GEO to FASTQ to 10x Genomics".
## 2. Each sample gets its own analysis to make sure it gets its own Cell Matrix (this is 2 FASTQ files though). 
## 3. Match dataset with its library based on the library preperation done in each paper
## 4. Use same pipeline for all - "CellRanger v9.0.1"
## 5. Use these reference datasets: "Mouse 2024-A" and "Human 2024-A" based on species for each dataset
## 6. Then be able to bring filtered matrixes into R
